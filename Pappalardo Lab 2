Lab 2
In the first part of this lab, I created a function that takes the input of a temperature and outputs a printed summary
of how hot, warm, cool, or cold it is based on ranges of temperatures in Fahrenheit. In the second part of the lab, I
created a chatbot that communicates with the user by name. The chatbot asks for two numerical inputs, and for the first
one returns the square of the number, and for the second returns the square root.

def feelTemp(temp):
# if temperature is above 100 F, prints 'It is hot.'
  if temp >= 100:
    print('It is hot.')
# if temperature is at least 70 and less than 100 F, prints 'It is warm.'
  elif temp >= 70 and temp < 100:
    print('It is warm.')
# if temperature is at least 32 and less than 70 F, prints 'It is cool.'
  elif temp < 70 and temp >= 32:
    print('It is cool.')
# in all other cases, whereby temperature is under 32 F, prints 'It is cold.'

print('The square root of that number is', square_root, '! That\'s enough math for today. So long!')
