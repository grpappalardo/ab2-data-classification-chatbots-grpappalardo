My first script takes an input of the current temperature and outputs what that feels like.
When working on this code I had trouble getting the input to be properly processed by the feelTemp function. I looked up the error on StackOverflow and learned the correct way to format the input so it is converted to int: int(input('What is the temperature today?')).


My second script is a chatbot that interacts with the user and returns mathematical operators. For the first user inputted number, the bot returns the square of that number, and for the second it returns the square root, then ends the discussion.
As I worked on this code I used a technique akin to incremental development. I knew I wanted to create a chatbot that performed mathemtical operations on user inputted numbers, but I also wanted to incorporate personalization by asking for and using names. I had to make some edits to the responses to make it print both properly. StackOverflow helped me refresh my understanding of how to have a print statement include both strings and variables.
