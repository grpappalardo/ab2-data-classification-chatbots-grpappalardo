My first script takes an input of the current temperature and outputs what that feels like.
When working on this code I had trouble getting the input to be properly processed by the feelTemp function. I looked up the error on StackOverflow and learned the correct way to format the str input so it is converted to int: int(input('What is the temperature today?')).


My second script is a chatbot that interacts with the user and does mathematical operations on user inputted numbers. For the first user inputted number, the bot returns the square of that number, and for the second it returns the square root, then ends the discussion. As I worked on this code I used the incremental development technique, so I checked and finetuned my code as I went along. I knew I wanted to create a chatbot that performed mathematical operations on user inputted numbers, but I also wanted to incorporate personalization by asking for and using names. I had to make some edits to the responses so both printed properly. StackOverflow helped refresh my understanding of how to make a print statement that includes both strings and variables.
